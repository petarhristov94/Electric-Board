# Summary

**28/08/2016**: Updated file for better fit against the core

**July 19th, 2016**: Updated the files due to some tolerancing issues. I reprinted the mating component of all 3 pulleys and Flatface adaptor, you should have no issues going forward.

If you're into building and talking about esk8s then come pay us a visit: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/

The pre-bored holes are intended for 10-24 tap. If you dont have access to a tap, you can drill these out a little larger using a number 25 drill bit for imperial (.150")  which is 3.81mm in metric so 4mm would also work. Once you secure a good fit on your wheels, a small drop of superglue on the threads of the screw is encouraged to prevent the screws from coming loose due to vibrations.

10-24 by 2 Inch Machine Screws work perfectly with this design and will not hit your trucks (Caliber or Paris) and probably other though I have not tested others myself.

No modifications to your trucks are required for use.

Enjoy.

There is tons of work that went into making these and the other pulley series on here so if you wish to contribute feel free to donate any amount you wish.
